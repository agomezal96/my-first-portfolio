    <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Andrea and I live in Barcelona. I'm a junior developer with a
        master's degree in user experience design from the Open University of
        Catalonia (UOC), a postgraduate degree in digital and print book design
        (also with the UOC), and a degree in Biochemistry from the University of
        Barcelona. And I'm currently learning to program!
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always loved writing down my ideas, stories, and thoughts, and even
        as a child, I created little blogs to share them with the world. Now I'm
        learning how to create websites and apps, and I'm really enjoying it.
        I'm passionate about creating and organizing content, giving it an
        attractive visual structure, and making it interactive. I'd like to
        create digital products that have an impact on the well-being of
        everyone in the world (yes, humans, animals, and even plants!).
      </p>

      <p>I would define these as my three passions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reading and writing fantasy stories.</li>
        <li>
          Birds. I adore all kinds of birds. I have two parrots, and they're my
          family. I also love helping and rescuing birds because they're among
          the most helpless and misunderstood animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Games! I like everything from board games and video games to
          larger-scale games like escape rooms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am a person who gets involved and takes a lot of responsibility for
        what I do, to the point that sometimes I worry excessively, so one of my
        favorite phrases that I often repeat to myself is from a great sage:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "If a problem can be solved, there is no use worrying about it. If it
          can't be solved, worrying will do no good"
        </p>
        <cite>Dalai Lama</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This is one of my favorite places I visit online to disconnect from my
        daily tasks and connect with my inner world:
