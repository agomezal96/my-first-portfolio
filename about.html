        <span class="hi"> Hi! </span>
        <p>
          I'm Andrea and I live in Barcelona. I'm a junior developer with a
          master's degree in user experience design from the Universitat Oberta
          de Catalunya (UOC), a postgraduate degree in digital and print book
          design (also with the UOC), and a degree in Biochemistry from the
          Universitat de Barcelona. And I'm currently learning to program!
        </p>

        <p>
          I've always loved writing down my ideas, stories, and thoughts, and
          even as a child, I created little blogs to share them with the world.
          Now I'm learning how to create websites and apps, and I'm really
          enjoying it.
          <strong>
            I'm passionate about creating and organizing content, giving it an
            attractive visual structure, and making it interactive. I'd like to
            create digital products that have an impact on the well-being of
            everyone in the world
          </strong>
          (yes, humans, animals, and even plants!).
        </p>

        <p>I would define these as my three passions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reading and writing <em>fantasy stories</em>.</li>
          <li>
            <em>Birds</em>. I adore all kinds of birds. I have two parrots, and
            they're my family. I also love helping and rescuing birds because
            they're among the most helpless and misunderstood animals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Games</em>! I like everything from board games and video games
            to larger-scale games like escape rooms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I am a person who gets involved and takes a lot of responsibility for
          what I do, to the point that sometimes I worry excessively, so one of
          my favorite phrases that I often repeat to myself is from a great
          sage:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "If a problem can be solved, there is no use worrying about it. If
            it can't be solved, worrying will do no good"
          </p>
          <cite>Dalai Lama</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This is one of my favorite places I visit online to disconnect from my
          daily tasks and connect with my inner world:
